# EM-algorithm - Academic project

An academic research and implementation of the expectationâ€“maximization algorithm, with PYTHON and R.

To start off, clone the project: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Samashi47/EM-algorithm.git
```

Then:
```shell
cd EM-algorithm
```

# R implementation

> [!NOTE]
>
> Here we suppose that R is fully installed and configured on your computer.
>
> R-markdownn doesn't require any further configuration to run on Rstudio or VSCode, but for a more rich experience on VSCode (live preview, generate HTML, LaTeX and pdf files) you need a TeX distribution, and pandoc on your computer. You can install pandoc from https://pandoc.org/installing.html

To start with the R implementation, you should install the required packages first, go to the R console, then: 
```R
install.packages(c("base", "methods", "datasets", "utils", "grDevices", "graphics", "stats", "plyr", "mvtnorm", "ggplot2"))
```
Then you are ready to run the implementations in the .rmd files chunk by chunk.
